# Cairo Matrix Operations
This project provides implementations of matrix multiplication and matrix-vector multiplication in the Cairo language, designed to work within zero-knowledge proof and distributed system.

# Overview
The repository includes two main components:

Matrix Multiplication: A Cairo program that performs multiplication of two matrices using a map reduce approach.
Matrix-Vector Multiplication: A Cairo program that multiplies a matrix by a vector, both of which are crucial in various computational and cryptographic contexts, especially within zk-SNARKs.
These implementations are designed to demonstrate how complex mathematical operations can be executed within the Cairo language, maintaining the integrity and privacy guarantees provided by zk proofs.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Cairo language environment.
Scarab for compiling and testing Cairo programs.
